## Purpose
This repository collects codes that I used to learn coding HA(NK) models. I learned a lot from other people's codes, so I also wanted to share mine. 
I hope that other researchers will find them useful.  

The codes are for illustration purposes only and are not optimized for speed. 

If you find any errors or have other comments, please let me know: s.woehrmueller[at]googlemail.com. 

## Content
- Aiyagari contains files that solve the Aiyagari model (with labor supply choice) in steady-state and with transitional dynamics
- HANKNotebooks build up a HA(NK) model including transition step-by-step. The model is solved using a quasi-Newton method for illustration. 
- KS_SSJ.ipynb is a notebook that solves the Krussel-Smith model as in Auclert, Bardóczy, Rognlie, Straub (2021) with and without investment adjustment costs using sequence-space Jacobian methods.
